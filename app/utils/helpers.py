"""
Utility functions and helpers used throughout the application.

This module contains reusable, low-level functions or logic that do not belong to any specific domain
(e.g., formatting, parsing, logging wrappers, ID generation, date/time conversion).

Purpose:
- Centralizes cross-cutting concerns and generic logic.
- Keeps business logic and route handlers clean and focused.
- Avoids duplication by reusing common operations.

Impact on SDLC:
- Promotes maintainability by isolating helper logic in one place.
- Improves testability: each utility can be independently tested.
- Supports DRY principles and reduces coupling between modules.
- Ensures long-term scalability by preventing logic bloat in domain-specific files.
