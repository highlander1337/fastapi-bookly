"""
API root package.

Purpose:
- Serves as the entry point for all API-related logic in the application.
- Organizes API routes, dependencies, exception handling, and versioning under a unified structure.

What to include:
- Subdirectories for each API version (e.g., `v1`, `v2`, etc.).
- Global exception handlers or custom error responses (`exceptions.py`).
- Middleware logic specific to the API boundary (e.g., CORS, rate limiting, logging).
- OpenAPI/Swagger customization logic (`openapi.py`) to enrich API docs.
- API-specific settings or environment flags (e.g., `api_config.py`).
- Mounting logic for third-party integrations (e.g., healthcheck, metrics, Prometheus).

Recommended Practices:
- Avoid placing business logic or database interaction directly in this layer.
- Keep concerns focused on request/response transformation, validation, and routing.

Impact on SDLC:
- Encourages a clean, scalable API design via modular versioning.
- Improves onboarding and maintainability by clearly organizing HTTP-entry logic.
- Provides flexibility to implement policies like global guards, CORS, observability, and tracing at the API level.
