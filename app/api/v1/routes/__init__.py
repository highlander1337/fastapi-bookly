"""
API route grouping for version v1.

Purpose:
- Organizes all FastAPI route handlers by domain under the v1 API namespace.
- Defines HTTP endpoints that map incoming requests to business logic via services and schemas.

What to include:
- One module per resource or domain (e.g., `users.py`, `books.py`, `auth.py`, `reports.py`).
- Each module should define an `APIRouter` instance and encapsulate:
  - HTTP verb handling (`GET`, `POST`, etc.)
  - Schema validation (input/output)
  - Dependency injection for DB access, auth, etc.
  - Calls to the service layer or orchestrators

Optional additions:
- Grouped subfolders if route sets grow large (e.g., `admin/`, `public/`, `internal/`).
- Custom tags or route-specific metadata for OpenAPI grouping.
- Route-level permissions or feature toggles, if version-specific.

Recommended Practices:
- Keep routing logic thinâ€”do not embed business logic here.
- Return only serializable data or well-formed responses via schemas.
- Avoid coupling route logic to database operations directly.

Impact on SDLC:
- Reinforces clean architecture by keeping transport (HTTP) separate from business rules.
- Improves testability, as route handlers become composable units.
- Supports scalability by organizing routes into modular, domain-specific files.
