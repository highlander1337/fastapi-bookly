"""
Version 1 (v1) of the API.

Purpose:
- Encapsulates all version-specific API logic and HTTP endpoints for the v1 namespace.
- Provides a strict boundary layer to protect backward compatibility across API iterations.

What to include:
- `routes/`: HTTP route handlers for distinct resource domains (e.g., `users.py`, `books.py`).
- `dependencies.py`: Shared FastAPI dependencies (e.g., current user, DB session, pagination).
- `responses.py` (optional): Standardized response format definitions or helpers.
- `schemas/` (optional): Version-specific Pydantic schemas if v2 introduces breaking schema changes.
- `permissions.py` (optional): Role or policy-based access control definitions scoped to v1.
- `rate_limiter.py` or throttling strategies if limits vary across versions.
- Any feature flags or toggles related to v1 functionality.

Recommended Practices:
- Keep v1 logic immutable once released; only bug fixes and non-breaking changes should be added.
- Use shared services and schema layers to minimize duplication unless v2 diverges significantly.

Impact on SDLC:
- Allows safe evolution of the API through additive and non-breaking changes.
- Reduces cognitive load by scoping all logic relevant to v1 under a single module.
- Encourages test coverage and regression isolation for each API version independently.
