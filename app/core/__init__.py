"""
Core application infrastructure and lifecycle utilities.

Purpose:
- Centralize cross-cutting concerns that affect the entire FastAPI application.
- Provide modular, reusable components for startup/shutdown events, security, and environment setup.
- Serve as the foundational layer for system-level features outside domain/business logic.

Contents:
- `events.py`: Defines application startup and shutdown logic such as database readiness checks, service warm-up routines, and graceful shutdown procedures.
- `security.py`: Contains authentication and authorization utilities, including JWT handling, OAuth2 support, and password hashing.
- Planned modules (examples):
  - `logging.py`: Centralized configuration for structured logging.
  - `tracing.py`: Distributed tracing and observability setup (e.g., OpenTelemetry integration).
  - `monitoring.py`: Metrics collection and export (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
  - `middleware.py`: Global FastAPI middleware such as CORS, request logging, and rate limiting.
  - `exceptions.py`: Custom exception classes and standardized error responses.

Recommended Practices:
- Avoid embedding business/domain logic in this layer; keep it focused on infrastructure concerns.
- Maintain environment-agnostic code that works consistently across development, staging, and production.
- Use declarative and reusable patterns to enable easy integration with other layers of the application.

Impact on SDLC:
- Improves maintainability by isolating system-wide concerns in a dedicated layer.
- Enhances reliability through structured and testable startup/shutdown workflows.
- Facilitates observability and debugging with centralized infrastructure components.
- Supports application scalability by cleanly separating non-functional concerns from domain logic.
