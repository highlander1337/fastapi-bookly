"""
Application package initializer.

This module marks the `app` directory as a Python package and provides high-level context
for the structure and responsibilities of the application.

Overview:
The `app` package is the core of the FastAPI project and encapsulates configuration,
startup logic, and modular architecture for API routing, business logic, and utilities.

Included Modules:
- `main.py`: Bootstraps the FastAPI app, registers routes, and configures the runtime environment.
- `config.py`: Centralized application settings using Pydantic's `BaseSettings`, loaded from `.env` or environment variables.
- `api/`: Contains versioned route definitions and API endpoints.
- `services/`: Contains business logic (use cases) that interface between routes and persistence.
- `schemas/`: Pydantic models for request validation and response serialization.
- `db/`: Handles database models, session management, and migrations.
- `utils/`: Cross-cutting utility functions and low-level support logic (e.g., formatting, parsing).

Purpose:
- Define the root namespace for all core components of the backend.
- Enable clean project structure and modular separation of concerns.
- Support maintainable, testable, and scalable architecture aligned with best practices.

Impact on SDLC:
- Establishes a clear architectural foundation for onboarding and extension.
- Encourages consistency in module responsibilities.
- Serves as the starting point for static analysis, auto-documentation, and dependency resolution.
