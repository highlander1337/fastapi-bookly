"""
Unit and integration tests for user-related functionality.

This module contains test cases that verify the correctness of user-related operations,
such as registration, login, profile access, and error handling. It uses test clients,
fixtures, and mock dependencies to simulate real-world scenarios while maintaining test isolation.

Purpose:
- Ensure user routes and services behave as expected under various conditions.
- Detect regressions early by validating critical user flows (e.g., auth, creation).
- Validate input/output contracts and edge cases for robustness.

Impact on SDLC:
- Supports Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines with fast, automated checks.
- Increases confidence in code changes by preventing unintended side effects.
- Encourages a test-driven mindset and reliable delivery of user features.
- Facilitates refactoring and feature evolution with safety nets in place.
- Enhances code quality, system reliability, and developer confidence.

Testing Scope:
- Route-level tests (e.g., POST `/users/`, POST `/login`)
- Authentication and permission logic
- Service-layer behaviors (e.g., password hashing, user lookups)
- Schema validation and error response structures
