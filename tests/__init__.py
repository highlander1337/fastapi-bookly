"""
Test suite package initializer.

Marks the `tests` directory as a Python package and provides high-level context
for how testing is structured and organized in this project.

Overview:
The `tests` package contains all automated test cases for verifying the correctness,
resilience, and performance of the application. It includes both unit tests and
integration tests, structured by domain or functionality (e.g., `test_books.py`, `test_users.py`).

Purpose:
- Centralize testing logic to ensure consistent validation across all components.
- Provide early detection of bugs and regressions through automated checks.
- Support CI/CD pipelines and quality assurance standards.

Testing Strategy:
- Focuses on both **unit tests** (isolated service and logic validation) and
  **integration tests** (API and DB interaction, end-to-end workflows).
- Leverages FastAPIs `TestClient`, dependency overrides, and mocking for isolation.
- Emphasizes coverage of critical paths, edge cases, and contract validation (input/output schemas).

Impact on SDLC:
- Enables confident refactoring and iterative development.
- Facilitates robust deployment practices with minimal risk.
- Encourages a quality-first culture via automated validation and documentation.

Structure:
- `test_books.py`: Covers all book-related endpoints and business logic.
- `test_users.py`: Covers user-related flows including auth, creation, and profile access.
- Fixtures, factories, and test utilities (if any) should be placed in a `conftest.py` or `utils/`.

Recommended Practices:
- Follow the **AAA pattern** (Arrange, Act, Assert) for clear and maintainable tests.
- Use descriptive test names and docstrings for self-documenting behavior.
- Maintain high coverage for critical paths; avoid over-testing trivial logic.
