## Command to create an alembic folder

``` bash
alembic init -t async `folder_name`
```

Alembic plays a **critical role** in managing the **evolution of the database schema** in a FastAPI + PostgreSQL project. To understand *why it's needed*, letâ€™s break it down from the perspectives of:

## ðŸ§  High-Level Design (HLD)

At a high level, your FastAPI application consists of:

* **Business Logic Layer (FastAPI routes, services)**
* **Data Layer (PostgreSQL database with models)**
* **Schema Definitions (SQLModel / SQLAlchemy models)**
* **DevOps/Deployment infrastructure**

Without Alembic:

* You have no clean mechanism to evolve the database schema over time.
* Any schema change (e.g., adding a new column) would require manual SQL migrations, which is error-prone and hard to track.

With Alembic:

* You introduce a **migration system** that tracks changes to the schema **as part of the source code**.
* It enables **versioned schema evolution**, aligned with application code updates.
* It's part of the **Infrastructure as Code** philosophy.

> âœ… In HLD terms, Alembic serves as the **Schema Version Control Subsystem**.

---

## ðŸ”§ Low-Level Design (LLD)

From the LLD perspective, letâ€™s say you have a model like:

```python
class User(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: int = Field(primary_key=True)
    name: str
```

Now you add a new field:

```python
email: str | None = None
```

You need this change to reflect in the **actual database table**.

Without Alembic:

* Youâ€™d need to manually ALTER the table via SQL.
* Hard to automate, error-prone, not trackable.

With Alembic:

* You generate a migration with:

  ```bash
  alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add email to user"
  ```

* It detects the change and produces a versioned migration file.
* You apply it with:

  ```bash
  alembic upgrade head
  ```

* Migration scripts become part of your repository and deployment flow.

> âœ… In LLD, Alembic acts as the **automated database schema migration engine** that supports **code-first database design**.

---

## ðŸ”„ Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

Hereâ€™s how Alembic fits into each phase of the SDLC:

| Phase           | Role of Alembic                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Planning**    | Database schema changes are planned alongside feature planning.                 |
| **Design**      | Alembic integrates into architectural design as the schema change manager.      |
| **Development** | Developers write models, autogenerate Alembic migrations, and test them.        |
| **Testing**     | Test databases are spun up with the latest schema via `alembic upgrade`.        |
| **Deployment**  | Alembic migrations run as part of CI/CD pipelines (e.g., in Docker entrypoint). |
| **Maintenance** | Future changes are handled safely through new migrations; history is preserved. |

> âœ… In SDLC terms, Alembic enables **repeatable, auditable, and automated schema changes**, which is vital for collaboration, deployment, rollback, and maintainability.

---

## ðŸ”’ Why Alembic is **Needed**, Not Just "Nice to Have"

* Schema changes are inevitable.
* Manual SQL migrations donâ€™t scale.
* Migrations must be versioned, tested, and deployed just like code.
* It avoids desync between models and the actual database.
* Alembic is fully compatible with **async**, **SQLModel**, and **SQLAlchemy**, making it the de-facto standard in FastAPI projects.

## âœ… Summary

| Perspective | Why Alembic Matters                                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **HLD**     | Provides a schema versioning system as a core infrastructure component   |
| **LLD**     | Automates and tracks DB schema changes aligned with model changes        |
| **SDLC**    | Supports safe, repeatable migrations in dev, test, CI/CD, and production |
